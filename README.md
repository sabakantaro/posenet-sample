# Posenet - React WebApp
This project uses Posenet Model in TensorflowJS inside a React Webapp.
It uses live webcam feed from the browser and runs the posenet model over it.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
- Open terminal in root folder 
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Type `npm start` to start the webapp in your webbrowser

- Note: The posenet model is not cached locally, so you will need the internet to download the model at runtime.
